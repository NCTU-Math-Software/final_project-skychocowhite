## How to use
1. Download **`crofton_formula.m`**.
2. Open **`MATLAB`**, and put the file in the directory in current folder of **`MATLAB`**.
3. Change the parametric equations in functions `X_t` and `Y_t` to your curve equations. Also, if you can, calculate the accurate curve length and change value in `disp` to check approximate error.
4. In **`MATLAB`**, run the command
```
T = [a,b]  % Enter a, b with your own parameter interval
crofton_formula(T)  % Run the function
```
5. See result.
